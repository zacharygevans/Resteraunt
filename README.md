The following project is a fictional resteraunt.
This blog utilized HTML and CSS concepts. 
The ability to subscribe to a mailing list and to contact the page owner through an e-mail inquiry. Plausible ideas for future improvement include converting recipes blog into a functioning mock resteraunt website, providing more CSS styling for a more stylized user interface and adding the ability for user's to submit orders.
